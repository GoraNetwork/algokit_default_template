ABI Examples
------------

Demonstrates some usage of the PyTeal ABI types.

ABI Types are defined in the [ARC-4 spec](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0004.md) and are very useful for a standard encoding of complex types. They allow for easier interoperability with other contracts that use the same encoding. 


See https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/abi.html for more information on the PyTeal types.
