# AlgoKit Playground Template

This template provides a good starting point to quickly play with writing, building and deploying/calling Beaker and PyTEAL contracts.

This is one of the default templates used by AlgoKit to initialise an Algorand smart contract project. It's a [Copier template](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Features

This template supports the following features:

* Compilation of the current Beaker contract (see e.g. playground/hello_world/build.py)
* Demo (deploy + call) of the current Beaker contract (see e.g. playground/hello_world/demo.py)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python dependency management and virtual environment management
* VS Code configuration (linting, formatting, breakpoint debugging)
* dotenv (.env) file for configuration


# Getting started

Once the template is instantiated you can follow the [README.md](template_content/README.md.jinja) file to see instructions for how to use the template.
