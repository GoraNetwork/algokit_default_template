# AlgoKit Goracle Basic App Template

This template provides a good starting point to quickly play with writing, building and deploying/calling Beaker and PyTEAL contracts and interacting with the Goracle Protocol.

This is a template used by AlgoKit to initialise an Algorand smart contract project. It's a [Copier template](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Features

This template supports the following features:

* Compilation of the current Beaker contract (see e.g. [default_app/build.py](./default_app/build.py))
* Demo (deploy + call) of the current Beaker contract (see e.g. [default_app/demo.py](./default_app/demo.py))
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python dependency management and virtual environment management
* VS Code configuration (linting, formatting, breakpoint debugging)


# Getting started

Once the template is instantiated you can follow the [README.md](template_content/README.md) file to see instructions for how to use the template.
